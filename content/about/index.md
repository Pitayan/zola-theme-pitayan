A few words about you.  Your opening text goes here.[^footnoteEx1]

## In-article heading --- it's an H2 because your title is the H1

And after another paragraph or two or three, you may want to add a subheading, which would be an H3, so it would be like the following.[^footnoteEx2]

### Subheading (H3)

Text here.

Closing text. That ends your "About" item!

[^footnoteEx1]: This is how a footnote works. Please note that Zola does **not** automatically put your footnotes at the bottom of your page, as many other static site generators do; so you must **manually** place your footnotes, in the desired order, at the bottom of your Markdown. This is because Zola uses [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) via the [pulldown-cmark](https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark) parser library (see [https://zola.discourse.group/t/is-there-a-way-to-customise-the-way-zola-parses-markdown-footnotes/694](https://zola.discourse.group/t/is-there-a-way-to-customise-the-way-zola-parses-markdown-footnotes/694)).

[^footnoteEx2]: This is a second footnote.
