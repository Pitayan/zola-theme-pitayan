This article suggests using more CSS and less JS to construct the web UI. To realize this target, it's preferrable to get farmiliar with as many as possible of CSS features. But it's quite difficult to know all them. Another solution instead is to follow the best pratices and reduce the code quantity.

Pseudo selectors to cover in this article:
- [1. :first-line](#1-first-line)
- [2. :first-letter](#2-first-letter)
- [3. ::selection](#3-selection)
- [4. :root](#4-root)
- [5. :empty](#5-empty)
- [6. :only-child](#6-only-child)
- [7. :first-of-type](#7-first-of-type)
- [8. :last-of-type](#8-last-of-type)
- [9. :nth-of-type()](#9-nth-of-type)
- [10. :nth-last-of-type()](#10-nth-last-of-type)
- [11. :link](#11-link)
- [12. :valid](#12-valid)
- [13. :invalid](#13-invalid)
- [14. :lang()](#14-lang)
- [15. :not()](#15-not)

## 1. :first-line
It represents the first line of text as its name implies.

```css
pre:first-line {

  color: green;
}
```

<pre className="demo first-line">
::first-line
selector
</pre>
<br />
<br />

## 2. :first-letter
Like `first-line`, it represents the first letter of the text.

Browser Compatibility: https://caniuse.com/#search=%3Afirst-line

```css
p:first-letter {

## 3. ::selection
The `selection` selector means those text you selected and highlighted. The color is <b className="bg-blue-300">blue</b> by default for most of the browsers.

```css
p::selection {

}
```

<p className="demo selection">

## 4. :root
The `root` selector represents the root element of a document. In `HTML`, the root element is `<html>` element. In `RSS`, the root element is `<rss>` element.

In most of the modern browsers, it's used for storing custom style properties. Use `var()` as a getter for the stored values.

  --bg-color: lightgray;
  --text-color: green;
}

p {
  background: var(--bg-color);
  color: var(--text-color);
}
```

<p className="demo root">
::root selector
</p>

## 5. :empty
The `empty` represents an empy element. An element without `space` `visible content` or `children nodes` is an `empty` element.

Browser Compatibility: https://caniuse.com/#search=%3Aempty

```css
p:empty {
  border: 1px solid black;
  height: 16px;
}
```

## 6. :only-child
The `only-child` represents the child node which the parent has only one child node.

Browser Compatibility: https://caniuse.com/#search=%3Aonly-child

## 7. :first-of-type
The `first-of-type` represents the node that is the first sibling of its type in the list of children of its parent element.

Browser Compatibility: https://caniuse.com/#search=%3Afirst-of-type

```css
p:first-of-type {
  background: lightgray;
}
```

```html
<div>
  <div>1</div>
  <p>2</p>
  <p>3</p>
</div>
```

<div className="mark-w-md">
  <div>1</div>
  <p className="demo first-of-type">2</p>

</div>


## 9. :nth-of-type()
`first-of-type` and `last-of-type` only represents the first or last element. With `nth-of-type`, you can select the node using its index. Remember CSS indexes start from **1**.

Browser Compatibility: https://caniuse.com/#search=%3Anth-of-type

```css
P:nth-of-type(2) {
  background: lightgray;
}
```

```html

  <p>3</p><!-- this one -->
</div>
```

<div className="mark-w-md">
  <div>1</div>
  <p>2</p>
  <p className="demo nth-of-type">3</p>
</div>

## 10. :nth-last-of-type()
Different form `nth-of-type`, `nth-last-of-type` counts from last one in the children list.

Browser Compatibility: https://caniuse.com/#search=%3Alast-nth-of-type

```css
P:nth-last-of-type(2) {
  background: lightgray;

</div>


## 11. :link
The `link` represents the unvisited `<a>` tag with href.

</p>


## 12. :valid
It's used in a form with validations. The `valid` represents the node that passed the validation.

  border: 1px solid green;
}
```

<div className="mark-w-md">
  <input className="demo valid mark-w-md" valid type="text" value=":valid" />
</div>

<br />
<br />
<br />


## 13. :invalid
So to `valid`, `invalid` represents the node that didn't pass the validation.

</div>

<br />
<br />
<br />

}

/* or */

Browser Compatibility: https://caniuse.com/#search=%3Anot

```css
div :not(p) {
  background: lightgray;

  <div>1</div>
  <p>2</p>
  <div>3</div>
</div>


These are the 16 pseudo selectors. Hope you've already got farmiliar with these selectors. Actually, there are a lot more pseudo selectors that are non-standards. So I neglected them. If you think this article is great, please share it on other social networks.
